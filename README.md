# Trading Indicators Library 
(Implemented in Ruby, Python, and C)

This repository contains a collection of trading indicator calculations, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of various programming languages in processing financial data. The indicators covered include:

- Stochastic Oscillator
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Know Sure Thing (KST)
- Chaikin Oscillator
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Bollinger Bands
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)

## Performance Benchmarks
The performance of each implementation was benchmarked on a dataset spanning one week. The results are as follows:

- Ruby implementation: ~2 hours
- Python implementation: ~2 minutes
- C implementation: ~2 seconds

## Project Context
This library is a subset of a larger project, extracted and organized into a separate repository for demonstration and benchmarking purposes.

## Usage Instructions

This project contains implementations of trading indicators in C, Python, and Ruby. Below are the instructions on how to run each version:

### C:
1. Ensure you have the PostgreSQL library installed on your machine.
2. Compile the C program using the following command:
    ```bash
    gcc c/indicators_recalculator.c -o c/indicators_recalculator -I/usr/include/postgresql -lpq -lm
    ```
3. Run the compiled program with the following command, replacing `<table_name>` with the name of your database table:
    ```bash
    ./c/indicators_recalculator <table_name>
    ```

### Python:
1. Run the Python program with the following command, replacing `<table_name>` with the name of your database table:
    ```bash
    python3 python/indicators_recalculator.py <table_name>
    ```

### Ruby:
(Note: The Ruby version is legacy and may not work out-of-the-box. It was originally part of a Rails application with associated migrations.)

1. To use the Ruby version, you would typically initialize an `IndicatorsRecalculator` object with the asset pair and interval as arguments, then call the `call` method on that object:
    ```ruby
    IndicatorsRecalculator.new(asset_pair, interval).call
    ```

## Database Setup
This project assumes the existence of a specific database schema. The repository does not currently include migration scripts to create the necessary database tables and columns. If needed, you may need to create these manually based on the code's expectations.
