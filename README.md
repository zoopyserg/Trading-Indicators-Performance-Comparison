# Trading Indicators Library 
(Implemented in Ruby, Python, and C)

This repository contains a collection of trading indicator calculations, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of various programming languages in processing financial data. The indicators covered include:

- Stochastic Oscillator
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Know Sure Thing (KST)
- Chaikin Oscillator
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Bollinger Bands
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)

## Performance Benchmarks
The performance of each implementation was benchmarked on a dataset spanning one week. The results are as follows:

- Ruby implementation: ~2 hours
- Python implementation: ~2 minutes
- C implementation: ~2 seconds

## Project Context
This library is a subset of a larger project, extracted and organized into a separate repository for demonstration and benchmarking purposes.
