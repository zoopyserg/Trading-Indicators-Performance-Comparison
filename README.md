# Trading Indicators 
(performed in Ruby, Python, and C)

Here, I calculate:
- Stochastic Oscillator
- RSI
- KST
- Chaikin Oscillator
- MACD
- Bollinger Bands
- EMA
- SMA

Some benchmarks (on 1-week worth of data):
- Ruby version takes roughly 2 hours.
- Python version - roughly 2 minutes.
- C version - roughly 2 seconds.

This is a part of a real project.
I extracted this code into a separate repo for demo purposes.
